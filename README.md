This is our manifesto. It expreses the way we want to live our lives here at our hub. WE all are responsible to maintain it, in form and substance, and act accordly to it.
No one owns it. No one has more power over it than the others. But everyone can ammend it or change it.

Rules are simple:
1. The version in master is the current accepted one.
2. We all commit to respect it, act accordly, recognize our mates who honor it and help those who don't.
3. If you want to change something, any kind of change, create a branch, change it and start a Pull Request.
4. If three team members from different teams approve it, it will be merge. If anyone objects anything, we will run a discussion over this topic, try to adapt the change to the objection and start over.

We all hope this will help us to live inside this hub in an harmonious way, building together the basics rules of coexistence.
